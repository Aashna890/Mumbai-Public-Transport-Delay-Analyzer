# Mumbai-Public-Transport-Delay-Analyzer
A data-driven solution to understand and analyze public transport delays in Mumbai using Python, Google BigQuery, and Power BI. This project simulates real-world transport delay data (bus, local trains, metro), stores it in Google BigQuery, and visualizes delay patterns using interactive dashboards.
##  Features

-> Random generation of transport data:
  -> Modes: Local, Metro, Bus
  -> Lines, Routes, Scheduled Times
  -> Weather Conditions and Delays
-> Simulates error scenarios: Cancelled, Early, On Time
-> Automatically uploads the generated data to a BigQuery table
